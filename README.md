# finance-tracker
My first project! This web application will accept inputs of expenses and utilise the info to provide advice to the user on how to better manage their finances.

## Project structure
- `frontend/` contains the Vite + React frontend
- `backend/` contains the Spring Boot backend (`pom.xml` and `src`)

To build or run the backend use Maven inside the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```
